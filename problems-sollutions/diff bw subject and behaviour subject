A BehaviorSubject holds one value. When it is subscribed it emits the value immediately. A Subject doesn't hold a value.

Subject example (with RxJS 5 API):

const subject = new Rx.Subject();
subject.next(1);
subject.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
Console output will be empty

BehaviorSubject example:

const subject = new Rx.BehaviorSubject();
subject.next(1);
subject.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
Console output: 1

In addition:

BehaviorSubject can be created with initial value: new Rx.BehaviorSubject(1)
Consider ReplaySubject if you want the subject to hold more than one value
